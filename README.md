# Imagesonification
## Abstract
This project involves working with a galaxy image dataset stored in a .npy file. The goal is to read the dataset, process the images using Python libraries like OpenCV and NumPy, extract pixel information (RGB/BGR), and visualize the images.
## Project Description
This repository contains scripts to:
- Load a dataset of galaxy images stored in an .npy file.
- Process the images to extract pixel data such as RGB or BGR values.
- Display the images using OpenCV and matplotlib.
- Store the pixel data in a CSV file for further analysis.
- Visualize the pixel data via heatmaps and other visualization techniques.
## Project Structure
- data/: Contains the .npy file of the galaxy images.
- .ipynb: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization.
- output/: Stores the extracted pixel data (CSV) and visual outputs.
