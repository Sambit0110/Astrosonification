# Astrosonification
## Abstract
This project involves working with a galaxy image dataset stored in a .npy file. The goal is to read the dataset, process the images using Python libraries like OpenCV and NumPy, extract pixel information (RGB/BGR), and visualize the images.
## Project Description
This repository contains scripts to:
1.Load a dataset of galaxy images stored in an .npy file.
2.Process the images to extract pixel data such as RGB or BGR values.
3.Display the images using OpenCV and matplotlib.
4.Store the pixel data in a CSV file for further analysis.
5.Visualize the pixel data via heatmaps and other visualization techniques.
- data/: Contains the .npy file of the galaxy images.
- .ipynb: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization.
- output/: Stores the extracted pixel data (CSV) and visual outputs.
